# Swab Swap
  
## Description:
Our concept was to create an application that allows people to connect within a community in an effort to get hard-to-find tests into hands of people who need them.This application allows users to login and view posts of community members who have at-home COVID tests available. Users can also create a post to announce they have tests available or that they are seeking tests.  This application allows users to securely create a profile to login, their session will be saved for the duration of the the time the user is logged in. For this application we used Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. 

## Installation Instructions:
Installation of the following npm packages required : bcrypt, sequelize, dotenv, express, express handlebars, sessions, mysql2, nodemon, session and Talkjs.
